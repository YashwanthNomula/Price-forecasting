# Price Prediction using XGBoost and Streamlit

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a price prediction model using XGBoost, a popular gradient boosting framework, and Streamlit, a tool for creating interactive web applications. The goal is to predict future prices based on historical data, which is provided as a CSV file containing hourly aggregated prices along with other relevant variables.
